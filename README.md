# Spam_Classification
A classification model in python which classifies a message is Spam or Ham. This can be useful to categorise emails i.e which mail is personal which is promotional etc. I used dataset of UCI( sms spam collection dataset ). I used NLTK package to remove stop words and text processing pandas, seaborn as data analysis and visualisation, The message is vectorised and TF-IDF is calculated for each unique word and Naive Bayes classifier from package sklearn is used giving precision of 0.97 .
